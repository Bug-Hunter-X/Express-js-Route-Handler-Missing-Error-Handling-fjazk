# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that doesn't properly handle errors from database operations, which can lead to server crashes or incomplete responses. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct implementation with proper error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a route handler that fetches user data from a database.  If an error occurs during the database operation, the error is simply logged to the console, and no proper response is sent to the client. This can result in a generic 500 error or a server crash.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors. It checks for errors from the database operation and sends an appropriate error response to the client if an error occurs.
